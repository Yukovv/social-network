When winter came, the ant was lying cozily in his home surrounded by the food he stored during the summer. While the grasshopper was in his home, hungry and freezing. He asked the ant for food and the ant gave him some. But it wasnТt enough to last the entire winter. When he tried to ask the ant again, the latter replied: УIТm sorry my friend but my food is just enough for my family to last until the end of winter. If I give you more, we too will starve. We had the entire summer to prepare for the winter but you chose to play instead.Ф",

There he chanced upon a lion who couldnТt walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although heТs scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lionТs paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didnТt harm the slave. Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lionТs den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the same lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed and he freed all the other animals.",
